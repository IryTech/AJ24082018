<h3>Join Our Anti Donation Campaign to Help Fight Corruption in Education</h3><hr class="hrline" />
<p>Admission in top private and government MBBS, Engineering and MBA colleges through donation under the banner Management Quota Seats or NRI seats is completely illegal in India. Still it has been prevailing for quite long back and is still there. Under the procedure of donation admissions, college managements take huge money from candidates to provide them back door admissions. Such admissions are in the form of management quota seats reserved for those students who score comparatively lesser than others. </p>
<p>Admission through donation implies to corruption and thus, stands forth as a national problem. It is not only contaminating healthy competition among students but also installing a wrong mindset. In this way, donation based admissions not only lead to corrupt society but also reflect biased attitude towards merit-listed aspirants. The worse, this system leaves deserving students bereaved of what they deserve and to a certain point affect their carrier. </p>
<p>Institutions and student’s parents involved into such practices are equally responsible for the malpractice. This is not the time for blame game and lame excuses. Let us take action against this. Lets create India a knowledgeable nation.</p>
<p>We, at Admission Jankari, have taken the initiative in this regard by commencing an anti donation campaign. This is a national-level program designed to help students fight against corruption in education. The points we would be focusing on and taking along are <i>declaring donation completely illegal, help students get admissions on merit basis and eliminate corruption out of education system.</i> </p>
